# Shortest Path Finder

The Shortest Path Finder is a web-based application that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate and visualize the shortest path between two nodes in a user-defined graph. This project demonstrates the application of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world problems, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with graph data.

## Features
- Input custom graphs with nodes and edges.
- Calculate the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Visualize the graph and the calculated shortest path.
- User-friendly interface designed with HTML,JS and CSS.
- Efficient algorithm implementation using Java.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Java
- Spring Boot
